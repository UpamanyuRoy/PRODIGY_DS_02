# **Exploring Data Through Cleaning and Analysis**
---

## **Description:**

This task involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a chosen dataset, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and uncover trends within the data. Through visualizations and summary statistics, we aim to better understand the structure and insights the dataset offers.

### **Steps:**

1. Data Loading and Exploration:
   - Load the dataset (e.g., titanic.csv) using Pandas.
   - Inspect the datasetâ€™s structure and summary statistics using methods like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()`.
   - Check for missing values using .isnull().sum() and assess data completeness.
   - Identify data types of each column and ensure consistency.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handle missing values through imputation or removal.
   - Convert categorical variables into appropriate formats if necessary.
   - Remove duplicate entries if present.
   - Handle outliers by visualizing distributions and applying suitable methods.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
   - Visualize the distribution of key features using histograms and boxplots.
   - Analyze relationships between variables using scatterplots and correlation heatmaps.
   - Explore categorical data through bar charts and count plots.
   - Investigate potential trends and patterns in the data.

4. Interpretation and Insights:
   - Summarize key findings from the analysis.
   - Highlight any interesting trends, relationships, or anomalies.
   - Provide potential next steps or questions for further analysis.
